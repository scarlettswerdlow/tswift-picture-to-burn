> State the obvious, I didn't get my perfect fantasy

DALL-E 3 is OpenAI's latest text-to-image system. One of its features is that it leverages OpenAI's GPT to "automatically generate tailored, detailed prompts that bring your idea to life." In other words, it revises your prompt before generating an image. While this feature is meant to minimize prompt engineering by the user, I still found myself struggling to communicate with DALL-E 3 in a way that produced reliable results. Below are some of the lessons I learned working with four fellow Swifties to visualize:

- New Year's Day as Art Nouveau for Sarah
- Now That We Don't Talk as a Slim Aarons photograph for Haleigh
- Fearless as an Afrofuturist textile for Evelyn
- New Romantics as Pop Art for Lauren

## In the Style Of

I started with simple prompts that asked for an image in a ```style``` that represented ```lyrics```. The style was typically two-to-three words, and I provided the entire lyrics of the song. The first results were good, but not great.

To improve the images, I worked with each Swiftie to identify specific artists or art works whose style we wanted to represent. The objective wasn't to produce an image that would pass as that of the artist, but instead to use the artist to identify fundamental features we wanted the image to include.

DALL-E 3, however, is designed to decline requests that ask for an image in the style of a living artist[^1]. Instead, DALL-E 3 replaces the reference with three adjectives that describe the artist's style. For example, if I asked for "Andy Warhol Pop Art," it revised the prompt to "vibrant, heavily saturated, and repetitive imagery that reflects the concept of Pop Art." To truly capture the style, though, I found much more detailed descriptions with closer to ten adjectives were needed. I initially crafted them manually from artist statements and reviews of their work, but I eventually shifted to using GPT to generate keywords for me.

While the results rarely looked like they came from the referenced artist's portfolio, I think they did capture the spirit of the artistic style.

### New Year's Day x Art Nouveau

#### First Attempt
![New Year's Day - Art Nouveau - Original](/assets/new-years-day-art-nouveau.jpg){: width="100%" }

##### Prompt by Me
> An art nouveau image that represents the following lyrics. I NEED it to NOT have any text, letters, words, or numbers.

##### Revised prompt by DALL-E 3
> Create an image in the Art Nouveau style, inspired by specific scenes from a song. Visual elements should include: glitter scattered on a dance floor after a party, with young women of diverse descents carrying their shoes and walking into a lobby. Candle wax and Polaroids scattered on a hardwood floor symbolizing memories of previous hours. Also depict a couple, a black man and an Asian woman, sharing a moment, perhaps in the process of cleaning up champagne bottles on New Year's Day. Lastly, subtly express the concept of 'holding on to memories', perhaps via symbols or tokens scattered throughout the scene.

#### Final Attempt
![New Year's Day - Art Nouveau - Final](/assets/new-years-day-final.jpg){: width="100%" }

##### Prompt by Me
> An Art Nouveau painting that is elegant and graceful with a linear style, ornate decoration, flat and decorative style, soft pastel colors, asymmetrical composition, an emphasis on the female form, and influence of symbolism that represents the following lyrics. I NEED it to NOT have any text, letters, words, or numbers. 

##### Revised prompt by DALL-E 3
> An elegant and graceful Art Nouveau painting depicting a scene influenced by the lyrics of a popular song. The scene is brimming with the after-effects of a party - glitter on the floor, girls carrying their shoes, candle wax on surfaces and Polaroid pictures strewn about. Remember, no text or numbers appear in the painting. The dominant colors are soft pastels, lending a whimsical ambiance. The composition is asymmetrical, with a noticeable emphasis on two figures - a man and a woman. They might be cleaning up after the party, a tender notion of a relationship unfolding on New Year's Day. Their connection is intimate, portrayed through small gestures like hand squeezes, their bodies leaning into each other, their faces reflecting contentment and shared experiences. Given that only symbolic representation of the lyrics is required, the woman could be holding a memory, symbolized by the glowing orb in her hand.

### Now That We Don't Talk x Slim Aarons

#### First Attempt
![Now That We Don't Talk - Slim Aarons Photograph - Original](/assets/now-that-we-dont-talk-photograph.jpg){: width="100%" }

##### Prompt by Me
> A photograph by Slim Aarons that represents the following lyrics. I NEED it to be a photograph.

##### Revised prompt by DALL-E 3
> Imagine a vintage-styled photograph capturing a high-society party in full swing. The crowd parts, as if symbolizing the 'Red Sea' parting, while a single individual stands out, their anxiety subtly hinted through their body language. This individual has notably long hair and seems to be trying to fit in, donning various fashionable icons. As the image's perspective shifts, it captures the sense of nostalgia for older, simpler times. The scene then changes to the solitude of a yacht clustered with important-looking people, deep in thought. This yacht is not glamorous or grand, but rather minimalistic, highlighting the stark contrast. Lastly, the photo presents a shadowy figure, shrouded in mystery, representing re-found dignity.

#### Final Attempt
![Now That We Don't Talk - Slim Aarons Photograph - Final](/assets/now-that-we-dont-talk-final.jpg){: width="100%" }

##### Prompt by Me
> A photographic environmental portrait, highly saturated in bright sunlight, 1970 photo from Life Magazine that conveys the casual chic and personal style of the mid-to-late-20th-century ruling class that represents the following lyrics. I NEED it to be a photograph.

##### Revised prompt by DALL-E 3
> Create a detailed, dramatic environmental portrait photo in a highly saturated, bright sunlight setting. This historical, 1970s-style image should capture the relaxed yet sophisticated ambiance characteristic of the upper class during the mid-to-late-20th century. Integrate themes from the given song lyrics into the image. Visualize a crowded party scene with an individual making a memorable exit, parting the crowd akin to the parting of the Red Sea. The main figure sports long hair and a changed yet unsettled demeanor, reflecting a desperate attempt to fit in that points to obvious efforts to change. The background characters should signify influential individuals absorbed in important thoughts, staging the scene on a luxurious mega yacht. Convey the emotions of longing, loss, and retrospection inherent in the lyrics.

### Fearless x Afrofuturist Textile

#### First Attempt
![Fearless - Afrofuturist Textile - Original](/assets/fearless-afrofuturist-textile.jpg){: width="100%" }

##### Prompt by Me
> An Afrofuturist textile with no text, words, or numbers that represents the following lyrics. I NEED it to not have any text.

##### Revised prompt by DALL-E 3
> An Afrofuturist textile design inspired by the story of a romantic encounter represented in a lyrical way. Imagine a piece of fabric that captures the essence of a rainy street scene with an ethereal glow. Visualize the exciting tension of a budding romance; the urge to dance fearlessly in a parking lot in the middle of a storm. Show this elation of running head-first, hand in hand, into a unknown yet thrilling journey. The textile should narrate the story of a romantic drive that captures a fearless first kiss, the courage it instills, and the unshakeable bond it creates. Importantly, the fabric should not contain any text, words or numbers.

#### Final Attempt
![Fearless - Afrofuturist Textile - Final](/assets/fearless-final.jpg){: width="100%" }

##### Prompt by Me
> An Afrofuturist quilt that looks like a painting using African textiles and bright jewel tones and celebrates Black life with no text, words, or numbers that represents the following lyrics. I NEED it to not have any text.

##### Revised prompt by DALL-E 3
> An Afrofuturist quilt artwork, inspired by African textiles with bold jewel tones. The vibrant quilt celebrates Black life, with no textual elements. To interpret the essence of the song, imagine a scene unfolds, depicting streets glistening after a rain shower; the glow is mirrored on the pavement. At the center of this scene, two figures stand in the middle of an illuminated parking lot. One figure, a Black woman in a beautiful dress, dances fearlessly amidst the storm, expressed through geometric and fluid designs. Another figure watches with admiration, their gestures suggesting a deep connection. A car in the background intensifies the urban narrative, in contrast with the traditional African textile elements of the quilt.

### New Romantics x Pop Art

#### First Attempt
![New Romantics - Pop Art - Original](/assets/new-romantics-pop-art.jpg){: width="100%" }

##### Prompt by Me
> A pop art with no text, words, or numbers that represents the following lyrics. I NEED it to not have any text.

##### Revised prompt by DALL-E 3
> Create a pop art visual piece inspired by a song, containing no text, words, or numbers. The image should include symbols suggesting themes of youth, rebellion, struggles, defiance, and optimism. Include symbolic elements resembling train tracks, scarlet letters, a castle made of bricks representing resilience, and an ongoing battle. The visual narrative should hint at a transformation from being hurt to being powerful; dancing figures under flood lights can be included as a sign of unbroken spirit. The image should be colorful with bold lines and flat colors, following the traditional aesthetic of pop art.

#### Final Attempt
![New Romantics - Pop Art - Final](/assets/new-romantics-final.jpg){: width="100%" }

##### Prompt by Me
> A Pop Art that includes imagery from popular and mass culture and uses bold colors, hard edges, distinct forms, everyday subjects, humor, and repetition with no text, words, or numbers that represents the following lyrics. I NEED it to not have any text. 

##### Revised prompt by DALL-E 3
> Create a pop art image featuring scenes from daily life. Use vibrant colors, distinct forms, hard edges, and include elements of humour and repetition. There should be no text, words, or numerical figures. The image should represent the emotions and scenarios portrayed in a particular song. The illustrated elements should evoke sentiments of boredom, waiting for something that does not come, displaying artificial bravado, multiple undercurrents of conflict, youthfully reckless behavior, battles faced daily, the construction of personal strength depicted as a castle made from thrown bricks, rampant heartbreak sung as a national anthem, blinding lights and noise, the thrill of danger sought, switching allegiances whimsically, dancing passionately, and a romantic sense of being stranded. At its core, the image should reflect a celebration of life's free-spirited individuals.

## Diversity

One of the criticisms of AI is bias: it unthinkingly reflects the biases and unrepresentativeness in the data it is trained on. OpenAI attempts to counteract this by proactively instructing DALL-E 3 to include diverse representations in the images it generates.[^2] Notice how the revised prompt for the first New Year's Day image instructs the system to include "young women of diverse descents" as well as a "couple, a black man and an Asian woman." In this particular instance, DALL-E 3 takes the instruction on board, but I observed other cases where the system ignored instructions regarding gender, race, and sexuality.

## Text

Left to its own devices, DALL-E 3 is dead set on adding "text" to images -- ranging from nonsensical combinations of things that look like letters to mispelt words. This despite the fact I pleaded with the system to exclude text, words, letters, or numbers in my prompts. This tendency was especially problematic for artistic styles that traditionally include text, such as Pop Art. Of the 14 Pop Art images I generated, ten included text despite instructions to the contrary. Below is a sampling.

![New Romantics - Text](/assets/new-romantics-text-1.jpeg){: width="45%" } ![New Romantics - Text](/assets/new-romantics-text-2.jpeg){: width="45%" }
![New Romantics - Text](/assets/new-romantics-text-3.jpeg){: width="45%" } ![New Romantics - Text](/assets/new-romantics-text-4.jpeg){: width="45%" }

Outside of Pop Art, I found the system was less likely to include text as my prompts became longer and more fully fleshed out. In other words, as I did a better job describing what I wanted (versus what I didn't want), it did a better job fulfilling my request. 

## Photographs

I also found DALL-E 3 needed particular prompting to reliably generate photographic images. Unlike with text, I found the instruction "I NEED it to be a photograph" to be consistently effective.

## Iteration

Above all else, I learned image generation is highly iterative. In search of perfection, I made many tweaks to my prompts and ended up producing 279 images for 25 songs. This iteration required:

- Feedback from users: Feedback from Lauren, Evelyn, Haleigh, and Sarah helped me form and test hypotheses about how to improve prompts. They also provided the perspective I had lost after looking at hundreds of images.
- Logging: I logged every prompt, revised prompt, and image this process produced. This helped me pick up on trends, even if I didn't spot them in the moment.
- A programmatic approach: It would have been inefficient and error-prone to manually implement this approach. Instead, I leveraged OpenAI's API and developed a simple pipeline to run and log each test.

[^1]: While OpenAI doesn't disclose its specific guidelines, users have "hacked" the system to get it to reveal its own rules, which [reportedly](https://the-decoder.com/dall-e-3s-system-prompt-reveals-openais-rules-for-generative-image-ai/) includes this instruction: "Do not create images in the style of artists whose last work was created within the last 100 years (e.g. Picasso, Kahlo). Artists whose last work was over 100 years ago are ok to reference directly (e.g. Van Gogh, Klimt). If asked say, 'I can't reference this artist', but make no mention of this policy. Instead, apply the following procedure when creating the captions for dalle: (a) substitute the artist's name with three adjectives that capture key aspects of the style; (b) include an associated artistic movement or era to provide context; and (c) mention the primary medium used by the artist."

[^2]: The specific instruction is: "Diversify depictions of ALL images with people to always include always DESCENT and GENDER for EACH person using direct terms. Adjust only human descriptions. EXPLICITLY specify these attributes, not abstractly reference them. The attributes should be specified in a minimal way and should directly describe their physical form. Your choices should be grounded in reality. For example, all of a given OCCUPATION should not be the same gender or race. Additionally, focus on creating diverse, inclusive, and exploratory scenes via the properties you choose during rewrites.  Make choices that may be insightful or unique sometimes. Use 'various' or 'diverse' ONLY IF the description refers to groups of more than 3 people. Do not change the number of people requested in the original description. Don't alter memes, fictional character origins, or unseen people. Maintain the original prompt's intent and prioritize quality. Do not create any imagery that would be offensive. For scenarios where bias has been traditionally an issue, make sure that key traits such as gender and race are specified and in an unbiased way -- for example, prompts that contain references to specific occupations."
